# VisAid
A tool that allows users to better understand their surroundings using image processing and speech recognition. Utilizing both Google Cloud Vision API and Houndify's Speech-To-Text API, VisAids lets users ask it questions about their environment and will respond with an answer. It does this by leveraging OpenCV to capture images and by using Text-To-Speech to respond to user queries.

## Make sure you install the following SDKs and packages before running: 
- sox 
- json
- io
- sys
- os
- gTTS
- OpenCV
- matplotlib
- [Houndify Python SDK](https://docs.houndify.com/sdks/docs/python#python-houndify-sdk)
- [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/)

### Authenticate with Google Cloud API prior to running code: 
Run this line in terminal: 
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=“/home/user/Downloads/[FILE_NAME].json”

### Run your program with this line of code: 
rec -p | sox - -c 1 -r 16000 -t s16 -L - | ./main.py *CLIENT ID* *CLIENT KEY*
 
Replace *CLIENT ID* and *CLIENT KEY* with your unique keys on your Houndify Dashboard
